# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ action ]
  #pull_request:
    #branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # job1
  skim:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
